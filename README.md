The govt of India promised to double the income of farmers by 2022 but they 
significantly lagged behind their target and bringing economic prosperity in their life. 
We planned a system which could bring inclusive growth in agriculture, helping small 
farmers and empowering them with the help of our system and connecting them with 
the technology so that they should harness the digital boom in agriculture sector. The 
various key features of the website will help farmers in best decision making from 
recommending crops and predicting crop disease. Thus, our project aims to bring a 
landmark change in agriculture sector of India by helping the farmers.
We will be developing a user-friendly website which will have various modules 
including live pricing of crops, query forum, crop recommendation system, video 
tutorial library, state helpline and disease prediction system. Thus, this website will be 
a one stop solution for various problems and needs of farmers.
We will be using machine learning and deep learning techniques for crop 
recommendation and disease prediction system, we will be performing proper data 
analysis, data cleaning and pre-processing and feature engineering techniques for the 
system. We would be using API for weather forecasting system and live crop pricing 
module. There will be various video tutorials and state helpline numbers for guidance
and connecting them with digital environment
